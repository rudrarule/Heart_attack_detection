I developed a heart disease predictive model and created a website that helps users track their health status. The model is built using a comprehensive dataset and incorporates multiple parameters to achieve high accuracy. Here are the steps I followed:

Data Collection and Preparation:

Dataset: I obtained a large dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which includes relevant features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and more.
Data Preprocessing: To ensure the quality and usability of the data, I handled missing values, normalized or standardized the data, and encoded categorical variables.
Model Building:

Feature Selection: I selected the most impactful features for predicting heart disease.
Algorithm Selection: I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM).
Training and Testing: I split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. I used cross-validation techniques to fine-tune the model parameters.
Performance Metrics: I measured the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the model's effectiveness.
Website Development:

Front-End: I designed an intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the website user-friendly and visually appealing.
Back-End: I implemented the back-end using Flask (a Python web framework) to handle user inputs and model predictions.
Integration: The predictive model is integrated into the website, allowing users to input their health data and receive real-time predictions on their risk of heart disease.
Deployment:

I deployed the website on a cloud platform (such as AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud) to ensure scalability and availability.
The website includes a feature for users to track their health status over time, providing insights and recommendations based on the model's predictions.
This project demonstrates the successful application of machine learning to a real-world problem, helping users monitor their health and potentially prevent heart disease.
