I developed a heart disease predictive model and created a website that helps users track their health status. The model is built using a comprehensive dataset and incorporates multiple parameters to achieve high accuracy. Here are the steps I followed:

Data Collection and Preparation:

Dataset: I obtained a large dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which includes relevant features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and more.
Data Preprocessing: To ensure the quality and usability of the data, I handled missing values, normalized or standardized the data, and encoded categorical variables.
Model Building:

Feature Selection: I selected the most impactful features for predicting heart disease.
Algorithm Selection: I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM).
Training and Testing: I split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. I used cross-validation techniques to fine-tune the model parameters.
Performance Metrics: I measured the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the model's effectiveness.
